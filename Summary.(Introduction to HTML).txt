Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

1.HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
2.Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
3.HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
4.Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.
5.Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.
6.<p>, <span>( for short text) and <div> (to make code look Nice) tags specify text or blocks.
7.The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
8.Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
9.Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted and inside both we use list itme <li> to wirte itmes.
10.Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.
  for images <img scr = "ImageLink.extension"/> (Note : image is self closing tag)
  for videos <videos scr = "VideoLink.extension" width = "320" height = "240" controls >Viode not supported </video>
