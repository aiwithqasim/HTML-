Validation Review
Awesome job adding client-side validation to <form>s!

Let’s quickly recap:

Client-side validations happen in the browser before information is sent to a server.
Adding the required attribute to an input related element will validate that the input field has information in it.
Assigning a value to the min attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable minimum value.
Assigning a value to the max attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable maximum value.
Assigning a value to the minlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable minimum number of characters.
Assigning a value to the maxlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable maximum number of characters.
Assigning a regex to pattern matches the input to the provided regex.
If validations on a <form> do not pass, the user gets a message explaining why and the <form> cannot be submitted.
